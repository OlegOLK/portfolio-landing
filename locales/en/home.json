    "question1": "How does iQube work?",
    "answer1": "Using various integrations with wallets and exchanges, iQube receives a complete history of trading operations and then simultaneously calculates the profitability of each transaction in two main currencies: BTC and USD.\n\niQube provides information such as total income earned in a period of historical account existence time, income for each trade, the effectiveness of your trading strategy in relation to the BTC hold, risk/profitability of the portfolio using the Monte Carlo simulation technique, profitability of each asset in the portfolio, and much more.",

    "answer2": "You will be asked to provide Read-Only API keys. Keys would be used for constant sync of your assets and trades.",
    "question3": "What is the Portfolio?",
    "answer3": "The portfolio is one of your virtual spaces where you connect wallets or exchange integrations that you want to track. You can have many portfolios and you can have many wallets in one portfolio.",
    "question4": "Can I edit trades that were imported?",
    "answer4": "No. As this is a trusted reflection of your trading progress, the service doesn't allow you to change trades. However, there are situations where you will be asked to provide some additional data for correct calculations. The service will  show you the steps when such a situation occurs.",
