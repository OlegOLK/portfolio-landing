    "answer3": "No. As this is a trusted reflection of your trading progress, the service doesn't allow you to change trades. However, there are situations where you will be asked to provide some additional data for correct calculations. The service will  show you the steps when such a situation occurs.",
    "question4": "What is the cost base setting?",
    "answer4": "Since the service doesn't know the initial prices of the assets you have, it takes the prices on the first trade date. However, it may not reflect the actual prices, thus,  you will be able to provide it per each asset in any supported currency.",
